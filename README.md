> This project uses a relational database and PostgreSQL. The database contains a data file with animals' information, the schema needed to create the table and related queries based on the diagram below:

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- I used [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- I used [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- I used [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
